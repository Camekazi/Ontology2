# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to **Claude Code** (`claude.ai/code`) when working with code and documentation in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repo contains the codeâ€‘first implementation of the **Dotwork "Narrativeâ€‘toâ€‘Ontology" Workspace** described in the PRD (v0.10 â€“ July 2025).  The project helps product teams transform an informal narrative into a structured, colorâ€‘coded ontology and a shareable concept mapâ€”without starting from a blank "fancy diagram."  It prevents **strategyâ€‘execution drift** by making relationships between *narratives â†’ things â†’ classifications â†’ ontology* explicit and queryable.

> *"Plans lose their power the moment strategy and execution drift apart."* â€” John Cutler

The repo functions as  â¬‡ï¸Ž

* **Core Library** (`/src`) â€“ NLP extraction, relationship inference, ontology export
* **CLI & Scripts** (`/tools`) â€“ edges â†’ Mermaid diagrams / JSONâ€‘LD conversion
* **Example Narratives** (`/examples`) â€“ sample input, golden ontology outputs, test fixtures
* **Docs** (`/docs`) â€“ PRD, architecture notes, ADRs and this CLAUDE.md

## Implementation Flow (per PRD)

```text
1. Capture Narrative   â€“ paste, upload or voiceâ€‘toâ€‘text
2. Find the Things     â€“ entity extraction (nounâ€‘chunks + custom tags)
3. Understand Relations â€“ edge suggestion with linguistic cues
4. Classify the Things â€“ default taxonomy (Timeâ€‘Period, Initiative â€¦ Principle)
5. Generate Ontology   â€“ graph + JSONâ€‘LD / GraphML export
```

A happyâ€‘path endâ€‘toâ€‘end run should finish in < 15 min on commodity hardware.

| Folder         | Object            | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `src/core`     | `Narrative`       | Raw text + metadata                         |
|                | `Entity`          | Thing reference, spans & classification     |
|                | `Relation`        | Directed, labeled edge between two entities |
|                | `Ontology`        | Final nodeâ€“edge graph + export adapters     |
| `src/ui`       | `MermaidRenderer` | Creates live graphs for docs / PR reviews   |
| `src/taxonomy` | `DefaultTaxonomy` | 10 base classes from the PRD appendix       |

## Claude â€“ How to Help

> The sections below are **Claudeâ€‘specific hints**.  Do **not** delete or rename them.

### ðŸš§ When Creating New Code or Docs

1. **Check existing implementations.**  Avoid duplicate entity/extraction logic.
2. **Align with PRD milestones.**  Place WIP code behind flags if the feature is listed for a later milestone.
3. **Write unit tests** in `/tests` that cover: extraction precision, relationship recall and ontology export fidelity.
4. **Document public APIs** with docstrings that match the taxonomy wording (e.g. *TimePeriod*, *Goal*).  Consistency helps downstream tools.

### ðŸ”„ When Updating the PRD

*Edit `/docs/PRD.md` directly.*  Make sure the **Northâ€‘Star Outcome**, **Goals**, and **KPIs** mirror any new capabilities you add.  Keep Mermaid examples minimalâ€”single graph per section.

### ðŸ“Š Mermaid Diagrams

Use Mermaid `flowchart TD` or `graph TD` to illustrate:\*\*

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A("Narrative") --> B["Entity<br>(Thing)"]
  B --> C{"Relation"}
  C --> D["Classified Thing<br>(Goal, Insightâ€¦)" ]
  D --> E["Ontology<br>Graph"]
```

*Prefer clarity over aesthetics.*  Do **not** add color in Mermaid; CI pipelines will theme the graph.

## Strategic Workflow (Highâ€‘Level)

```text
Strategic Intent â†’ Investment Agreement â†’ Customer Outcomes â†’ Measurement
          â–²                                        |
          â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Feedback â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

Each library change should answer: *"Which step does this accelerate or improve?"*

## Example Narrative (for tests)

> "Last quarter, we focused heavily on improving the onboarding experience, especially with the rollout of the new AIâ€‘powered insights â€¦"

A complete transcript lives in `/examples/narratives/exampleâ€‘01.txt` and the expected ontology in `/examples/ontologies/exampleâ€‘01.jsonld`.  **Keep these files authoritative**â€”regression tests rely on them.

## Pullâ€‘Request Checklist

* [ ] All new code has unit + integration tests
* [ ] Documentation updated (PRD milestones section, if scope changed)
* [ ] Storybook / CLI demo gif attached for UI changes
* [ ] Mermaid diagram renders in GitHub preview
* [ ] CI passes (typeâ€‘check, lint, test, build)

## House Rules

1. **No Obsidian assumptions.**  This repo is editorâ€‘agnostic; README snippets should work in any Markdown viewer.
2. **Outcome over output.**  A passing test that doesn't improve extraction accuracy is still a failure.
3. **Single source of truth**â€”PRD governs.  If code diverges, update code *or* submit a PRD change first.

*"Software should talk like the people who use it."*  Keep the language domainâ€‘specific and the code extensible.
