Our Q2 financial performance exceeded expectations, with revenue growing 25% year-over-year to $12.5 million. The sales team closed three major enterprise deals worth $2.1 million total, while our marketing campaigns generated 400% more qualified leads than the previous quarter. Customer retention improved to 94%, driven by our new customer success program launched in March. The engineering team delivered 15 feature releases, including the long-awaited API integration platform that customers had been requesting. Looking ahead, we're investing heavily in our data analytics capabilities and plan to hire 20 new engineers by year-end.
