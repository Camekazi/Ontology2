Last quarter, we focused heavily on improving the onboarding experience, especially with the rollout of the new AI-powered insights feature. The engineering team worked closely with the design team to implement a streamlined workflow that reduced user friction by 40%. Our customer success metrics showed significant improvement, with user activation rates increasing from 65% to 85% within the first week of launch. The initiative was led by Sarah Johnson and supported by the product team, who conducted extensive user research throughout Q3. Moving forward into Q4, we aim to expand these insights capabilities and target enterprise customers, building on the foundation we've established.
